# VAIL Verifier Extension

This repo is a browser extension that can verify proofs generated by the VAIL 
system. The goal is for browser-based AI applications to be able to share 
proofs of computation/inference performed on behalf of the end-user (the 
person using the browser). The AI application would signal to the browser
that a proof for a specific request and response is available for 
verification. The AI application would embed into the webpage links to
various artifacts necessary to run the verifier. The set of artifacts will
differ depending on the proving system being used. 

## Artifacts needed for verifier (ZKML)
1. Verify Key
2. Proof
3. Public Commitments

__Currently the main proving system used is ZKML. However, the verifier can be
updated to support other proofs such as those generated by EZKL.__

## Verifying

The verifier runs locally on the end-users machine (laptop or phone) within a WASM 
process. The verifier is meant to be light-weight compared to the computation being
proved as well as the proof generation.

Once the verifier process is complete, the UI will be updated to indicate the result
of the verification (pass or fail).
